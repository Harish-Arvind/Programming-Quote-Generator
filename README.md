# Programming Quote Generator

This is a simple Python program that generates programming-related quotes. The program reads quotes from a text file and provides the user with the option to display a random quote or view all quotes.

## Features
- Display a random programming quote.
- View all available quotes.
- Easy-to-use menu for interaction.
- Read quotes from a text file (`quotes.txt`).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text file named `quotes.txt` containing programming-related quotes.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Programming-Quote-Generator.git
   ```

2. Create a `quotes.txt` file in the same directory as the Python script. Add your favorite programming-related quotes, one per line.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 quote_generator.py
   ```

## Usage

When you run the script, you'll be presented with a menu with the following options:

1. **Random Quote** - Displays a random programming quote.
2. **All Quotes** - Displays all the quotes from the `quotes.txt` file.
3. **Exit** - Exits the program.

Simply choose an action by entering the corresponding number (1-3).
